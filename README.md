# This is the application codes for applying Fuzzy Regression Tree with Monte Carlo Methods.
# Root node calculation process should be applied first.
# After the seperation of root node then each level of leaves are calculated based on left and right leave codes.
# Tree depth can be increased using the same left-right seperation process.
